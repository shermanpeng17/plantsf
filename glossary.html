              <br>
              <p>A plant community is an assemblage of plant (animal and fungi) species that have co-evolved through
                time within a specific geographic area. The characteristics of every plant community are influenced by
                the physical environment – such as geology, topography and climate – as well as human disturbances, such
                as urban development. Several different indigenous plant communities remain in San Francisco. As in the
                rest of California, wetlands and riparian areas used to be abundant throughout the city, but are now
                restricted to only a few locations.</p>

                dominated by blue-blossom ceanothus and historically our endemic manzanitas. The southeastern slopes of
                Mt. Tamalpais in Marin County harbor the closet example of classic California chaparral.<br />

                Francisco. This plant community is characterized by low-growing, aromatic shrubs, such as coyote bush
                sticky monkey flower and California sagebrush. Coastal scrub thrives in the fog belt. We also have a
                more moisture-loving version of coastal scrub characterized by deciduous plants like  pink-flowering
                currant, California hazelnut and oceanspray, which can be found on Mt. Davidson in particular.<br />

                quarter to a third of San Francisco was once covered in sand dunes, and is still underlain by sandy
                soils. Remnants of a once biodiverse dune ecosystem still support a unique array of plants and animals.
                Plants in the coastal strand - just above the beach high tide line - commonly have small, waxy or
                succulent leaves, allowing them to survive in the dry, nutrient–poor sand while being battered by wind
                and salt spray. Behind the coastal strand are the &ldquo;foredunes&rdquo; which are more stabilized and
                support perennial shrubs. The dunes once stretched from Ocean Beach across the peninsula to Yerba Buena
                Cove (Downtown today), and harbored ponds and creeks. Wildflower meadows, dense dune scrub and oak
                woodlands are still found in the dunes.<br />

                rooted, soil-stabilizing, perennial bunch grasses, coastal prairies are important hunting grounds for
                raptors, coyote, and other predators, while also harboring a diversity of wildflowers - including rare

                many different kinds of wetlands, and San Francisco has several, including freshwater, saltwater, and

                in the Bay Area and provide a sheltered environment for many shade-tolerant species. The Richmond
                District has the most oak woodlands remaining in the city, including in northeastern Golden Gate Park
                and along the southern border of the Presidio.<br />

                collaboration with public and non-profit urban forestry stakeholders, including the Urban Forestry
                Division of the Department of Public Works and Friends of the Urban Forest. The list includes three
                sections, 1(A), 2(B), and 3 (C) defined by locations suited for different tree types. Just as with
                landscaping in general, it is important to match carefully the conditions of a site with the tree you
                choose. Please note that while the list contains recommendations that are known to do well in many
                locations in San Francisco, no tree is appropriate for every potential tree planting location. The list
                should be used as a guideline for choosing which street tree to plant, but should not be used without
                the help of a tree professional.</p>

              <p>The<a href="http://50.17.237.182/plantsf/index.html"> Plant Finder </a>can be used to search for street

                <h3 class="glossary-term" id="plantType">Plant Type</h3>

              </div>
              <br>
              <p><span class="glossary-term">Annuals:</span> These are plants that perform their entire life cycle from
                seed to flower to seed again within a single year. All roots, stems, and leaves of the plant die
                annually. Only the dormant seed bridges the gap between one generation and the next.</p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Perennials:</span> The term refers to any plant that persists for more than
                one or two growing seasons. Some perennials persist for many years including those in which the top
                portion of the plant dies back each dry season and grows back the following winter from the same root
                system. Many if not most perennials (in California) keep their leaves all year round.</p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Evergreen</span>: Plants which retain their foliage in all seasons and are
                green all year round are evergreens. This does not mean, however, that evergreens never lose their
                leaves. Evergreens conserve energy and nutrients by continually growing new leaves as old ones are shed
                during all seasons, but particularly during the dry season.</p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Deciduous:</span> Plants which shed their foliage annually at the end of
                the growing season are more usually associated with the deciduous forests of the eastern third of the
                U.S. California harbors many deciduous species of plants as well. Instead of shedding leaves due to
                cold, many deciduous plants in California’s Mediterranean climate zone shed their leaves during the dry
                season, in order to save energy and nutrients.</p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Tree/Shrub:</span> Trees are different from shrubs in that they have a
                single central stem or trunk, while shrubs often have multiple, thinner stems. Trees also tend to have a
                distinct shape and crown, while shrubs may consist of a large hedge that spreads over the ground. The
                other difference is that trees are generally thicker in the trunk and taller than shrubs.</p>

              <br>
              <p><span class="glossary-term">Rock:</span> Soil that is very pebbly, gritty, and composed mostly of large
                pieces of rocks. Rocky soil tends to have fewer nutrients than other soil types since  it has less
                organic matter. Rocky soil often does not hold water well, although this can vary. </p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Clay:</span> Soil composed of very small and fine particles that clump
                together and prohibit water and nutrient movement. They feel slick and sticky when wet and hold water
                well, but resist water infiltration, especially when they are dry. Puddles often form on clay soils, and
                they easily become compacted.</p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Loam:</span> Soil made of a mixture of sand, clay, and organic matter. Loam
                soils are very nutrient rich and store water well because of the heavy grittiness given from the sand,
                but also have exceptional drainage. When squeezed in your fist, moist loam will form a ball which
                crumbles when poked with a finger.</p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Sand:</span> Soil composed of relatively large, coarse particles visible to
                the eye and usually light in color. Sandy soil is loose and allows water and nutrients to penetrate
                easily, but also drains very rapidly and does not always allow for water and nutrient retention. Sand
                feels coarse when wet or dry, and will not form a ball when squeezed in your fist. </p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">All:</span> These plant species are extremely versatile and can grow in any
                soil type (Rock, Clay, Loam, Sand). </p>

              <p>The <a href="http://ucanr.edu/sites/WUCOLS/" target="blank">WUCOLS</a> system was used as a guide for
                information about species water needs. This field is designed to indicate average watering needs, with
                the assumption that the plant is already established, having survived a dry season. Plants may have
                different watering needs during their establishment phase. 99% of these plants should be able to survive
                without added water if they are planted in the right location. For example, a plant that is tagged
                &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; is usually a wetland plant, and so they are adapted to the summer drought insofar
                as their soil remains wet enough throughout the dry season. These plants are best planted at the bottom
                of a slope, or perhaps next to a fence, on the other side of which a neighbor may be watering regularly.
                If they are planted in an average moisture location then they will require water. </p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">None:</span> No watering needed after establishment. </p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Low:</span> Water about once or twice a month for the duration of the six
                month dry season. These plants can definitely survive the dry season with no added water if they are
                planted in the right place.</p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Moderate:</span> Water about once a week in a sunny location. Ideally, try
                to plant these species in low-lying and naturally moist areas and/or with ample shade..</p>
              <br><br>

              <br>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Garden:</span> Recommended plant for gardens or private property not within
                the public right-of-way.</p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Potted Plants:</span> These are all small stature plants that could do well
                in pots with the proper amount of watering. Even the most sun-loving, drought tolerant perennials need
                some water when living in a planter pot.</p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Roof:</span> A living roof is a roof of a building which includes
                vegetation and a growing medium as an integral component of the roofing system. Living roofs also
                include a water proofing and root repellant layer, a drainage system, filter fabric and sometimes an
                irrigation system. Living roofs are also called green roofs or vegetated roofs. The plants that do well
                on top of a roof tend to have shallow, fibrous roots and be drought tolerant, perennial or self-seeding,
                low-nutrient tolerant, heat tolerant, lightweight, adapted to sandy or free-draining soils, and low
                maintenance. The genus <em>Sedum</em> from the family Crassulaceae is the most commonly used for living
                roofs, but many other drought tolerant plant types can be successfully grown. In San Francisco, the lack
                of precipitation for six or more months of the year means that even extremely drought tolerant living
                roof plants will most likely need to be irrigated, at least during the establishment period. </p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Sidewalk:</span> Recommended plants for sidewalk landscaping or median
                planting. Recommended street trees for sidewalks and other public spaces based on the Urban Forestry
                Council's annually updated street tree list.</p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Stormwater:</span>These plants are recommended by the San Francisco Public
                Utilities Commission for planting in stormwater facilities or stormwater gardens when complying with the
                <a href="http://sfwater.org/index.aspx?page=1000" target="_blank">City's Stormwater Ordinance</a>. You

              <p><span class="glossary-term">SF Native</span>: These plants are indigenous to the northern San Francisco
                peninsula, and generally more broadly as well. A plant in this category could be endemic to the city
                itself or to the Bay Area or it could also have a range across North America and even Europe.</p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">CA Native</span>: These plants are indigenous to California, in particular
                the California Floristic Province, but are not native to San Francisco. This means they were never
                recorded here by early botanists, and are known to have ranges that do not include the northern tip of
                the peninsula.</p>

              <p><span class="glossary-term">Exotic</span>: The plants are not indigenous to San Francisco, nor to the
                rest of California. They may be from the eastern United States or anywhere else on Earth.</p>

              <p>Global climate change and biodiversity are the two most important environmental issues of the 21st
                century. The disruption and destruction of ecosystems around the world continues to contribute to global
                biodiversity loss. Ecological collapse also contributes to global climate change, which in turn may have
                profound effects on global biodiversity. Ecological restoration heals ecosystems and biodiversity; we
                should continue to expand ecological restoration in San Francisco. The healthier (i.e., less impacted by
                invasive species and other problems) our local ecosystems are, the more biodiverse and thus, more
                resilient they will be. Using local native plants for all forms of landscaping and greening in the city
                can make a real and significant contribution to the health, vitality and climate resilience of San
                Francisco’s natural heritage.</p>
